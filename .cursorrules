- When running terminal commands, always ensure the "finances" conda environment is activated first.
- If running a command in a new shell, prepend it with: conda activate finances && 
- If the shell already has the finances environment activated, you may run commands directly.
- Check the terminal metadata to see if conda is already activated before activating it again.
